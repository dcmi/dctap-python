Command-line tool
-----------------

To work correctly, "dctap" requires Python 3.6 or higher. Executing the command ``python3`` should show you if Python 3 is installed on your machine and in which version.

As explained below, the command-line utility can be installed either from the online PyPI repository, using the ``pip`` command, or from a local copy of the project on your own machine.
