Namespace Prefix Mappings
.........................

As explained in the section :ref:`cli_subcommands_read`, the :term:`Compact IRI`\s can be expanded into full :term:`IRI`\s by replacing the short prefix with the full IRI of the namespace. The default configuration settings provide a starter set of prefix mappings for frequently used namespaces. This list can be customized with locally defined namespaces or with namespaces listed in services such as `prefix.cc <http://prefix.cc/'_ or `Linked Open Vocabularies <https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs>`_.
