# duplicate-code: Tests do have alot of duplicate code.
# unspecified-encoding: Not really a problem, we use utf-8 everywhere, and these are just tests.
# unused-import: Useful not to have to continually add `import pytest` when debugging.
# protected-access: access to private variables is required for testing
# using-with: No need to open these small files within a context manager.
# unused-variable: These are just tests. Better to leave them for readability.
# invalid-name: Test module names with uppercase letters do not conform to snake case.
