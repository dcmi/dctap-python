.. _elem_shapeID:

shapeID / shapeLabel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the DCTAP model, all :term:`Statement Constraint`\s are seen as grouped into :term:`Shape`\s, where a Shape is about a :term:`Description` in :term:`Instance Data` --- a set of statements about just one :term:`Entity` in the real world.

A shape identifier is typically a plain :term:`Literal` or an :term:`IRI`.

If no **shapeID** is provided in the CSV or in a configuration file (see :ref:`config`), a default shape identifier will be assigned ("default"). A different default shape identifier may be configured, as described in the section :ref:`config`. For example:

.. csv-table::
   :file: shapeID.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Interpreted as::

    DCTAP instance
        Shape
            shapeID:                 default
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:date

Users with metadata about a single :term:`Entity`, or whose downstream applications do not make use of shapes, can safely ignore this default identifier.

In RDF validation languages that support shapes, shapes are typically identified with IRIs, so a warning will be emitted if a shape identifier, on a superficial inspection, does not look like an IRI.

.. csv-table::
   :file: shapeID_non_iri.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Interpreted as::

    DCTAP instance
        Shape
            shapeID:                 book
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator

    WARNING [book/shapeID] 'book' is not an IRI or Compact IRI.

Note that if a shape identifier is not provided for the first rows processed but is provided for rows processed thereafter, only the shape identifier for the first statement constraints will be the default.

.. csv-table::
   :file: shapeID_default_then_named.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Interpreted as::

    DCTAP instance
        Shape
            shapeID:                 default
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:date
        Shape
            shapeID:                 :author
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          foaf:name

Shapes can also have labels for use in displays and documentation.

.. csv-table:: 
   :file: shapeLabel.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Interpreted as::

    DCTAP instance
        Shape
            shapeID:                 :book
            shapeLabel:              Book
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator

Note that a shape label does not function as a shape identifier. If no value is provided for **shapeID** it will be assigned a (configurable) default. Only the assignment of a new **shapeID** will trigger the creation of a new shape. In the example below, the second **shapeLabel** ("Libro") is simply ignored.

.. csv-table:: 
   :file: shapeLabel_no_shapeID.csv
   :header-rows: 1

Interpreted as::

    DCTAP instance
        Shape
            shapeID:                 default
            shapeLabel:              Book
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator
            Statement Constraint
                propertyID:          dcterms:creator
