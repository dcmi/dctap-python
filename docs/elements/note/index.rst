.. _elem_note:

note
^^^^

The "note" element is a catch-all field for annotating any aspect of a Shape or of a Statement Template. 

Users requiring annotations that are more specific, for example to generate forms or displays, may want to extend the DCTAP model with more precisely defined annotation elements.
