.. _elem_valueConstraintType_builtins:

Built-in value constraint types
...............................

The **valueConstraintType** element is intended to serve as an extension point for implementers of the DCTAP model. As proof of concept, four commonly used value constraint types are supported by default:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   ../Picklist/index
   ../Pattern/index
   ../IRIStem/index
   ../LanguageTag/index

In contrast to the :ref:`elem_valueDataType`, which mark the datatype of literals in a form carried by :term:`Instance Data`, the value constraint type is intended to be used to trigger specific algorithms for transforming the values of a CSV cells, which are by definition only ever strings, into lists, regular expressions, or other data structures of the type used in programming.
